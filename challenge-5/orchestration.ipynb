      "Policy Number: LIAB-AUTO-001\n",
      "\n",
      "Main important details:\n",
      "- This policy is a Liability Only Auto Insurance Policy providing the minimum required coverage to legally drive.\n",
      "- Coverage includes damages and injuries caused to third parties but explicitly excludes coverage for damage to the insured's own vehicle or injuries to themselves.\n",
      "- Covered perils focus on bodily injury liability, including:\n",
      "  - Medical expenses for injured third parties\n",
      "  - Lost wages of injured parties\n",
      "  - Pain and suffering compensation\n",
      "  - Rehabilitation costs for injured parties\n",
      "  - Legal defense costs for covered claims\n",
      "  - Court-ordered judgments and settlements\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant exclusions and limits:\n",
      "- The policy does not cover physical damage to the insured vehicle.\n",
      "- It does not cover the insured's own injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting policy sections:\n",
      "- Section 1: Coverage Overview states, \"This liability-only auto insurance policy provides the minimum required coverage to legally drive in most states. It covers damages and injuries you cause to others but does not cover damage to your own vehicle or injuries to yourself.\"\n",
      "- Section 2.1: Bodily Injury Liability details the types of coverages offered including medical expenses, lost wages, and legal defense costs for third-party injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Based on the policy language, the LIAB-AUTO-001 policy covers liability for injuries and damages caused to others but expressly excludes coverage for damage to the insured’s vehicle and personal injuries. Therefore, any claim under this policy would be limited to third-party bodily injury liabilities. This implies that coverage determination must consider whether the claim pertains to liability to third parties, otherwise the claim would be NOT COVERED with respect to own vehicle damage or self-injury.\n",

      "Claim Status: QUESTIONABLE\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim CL001 involves a 2004 Honda Accord damaged in a parking lot incident on July 17, 2025. The damage description, witness statement, and police report details appear consistent and credible. Photos show severe front-left damage including bumper, headlamp, door, and wheel, supporting the claimant's description. Damage assessment indicates potentially high repair costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes necessary documentation—photos, police report, repair estimate, and witness information—all of which appear complete and adequate for review.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Damage and Cost Estimates: The repair estimate is from a credible local repair shop. The reported damage is severe enough to justify significant repair work, including mechanical checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Policy Coverage: No relevant policy document for LIAB-AUTO-001 was found in the database to confirm terms, limits, or exclusions. This is a critical missing piece; coverage validation cannot be completed without this.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Inconsistencies/Red Flags: The incident description matches photos and witness account with no immediate contradictions. The timelines and signatures are orderly. No suspicious elements detected but verification against policy terms is pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The actual insurance policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 was not found for reference; coverage details are unknown.\n",
      "- No estimate of deductible amount or confirmation of coverage limits.\n",
      "- No third-party claim assessment or independent adjuster's report present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Locate and review the policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 to verify coverage inclusions/exclusions, limits, and deductible.\n",
      "2. Confirm deductible amount and whether repair estimate aligns with policy limits.\n",
      "3. If available, obtain an independent adjuster's report to corroborate repair costs.\n",
      "4. Validate claimant's coverage eligibility based on policy terms before approval.\n",
      "5. Proceed with cautious approval contingent on policy confirmation and final damage appraisal.\n",
