Covered motorcycle types include street motorcycles (cruisers, sport bikes, touring bikes), scooters and mopeds (50cc+), dirt bikes, three-wheel motorcycles (trikes), electric motorcycles, and vintage models. The policy provides comprehensive protections including coverage for specialized motorcycle risks, custom parts, riding gear, and theft claims. Replacement cost coverage for new motorcycles is also included as an additional benefit. Coverage limits and deductibles depend on specific endorsements and selections chosen by the insured, which should be confirmed in the declarations page. Exclusions apply to racing events, commercial use, riding without a proper license, riding under the influence, stunting, reckless riding, and off-road use unless otherwise covered.
